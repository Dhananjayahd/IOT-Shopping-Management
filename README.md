# IOT-Shopping-Management
A iot system which updates the price of every item in a cart and displays the total price of all the products in cart 

The project was done during the internship program on “Design and Development of Embedded system using  Raspberry Pi and IOT” .
The project was based on IOT . In this the system updates the price of every item in a cart and displays the total price of all the product 
in a website. 
So thereby it reduces the time for standing in the queue in order to list the cost of all purchased product in shopping mall.
